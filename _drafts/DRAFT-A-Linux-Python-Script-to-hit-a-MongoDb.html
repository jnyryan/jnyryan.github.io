Here's one I struggled with for a while and it's not that hard.  I wanted to create a quick Python script to hit a MongoDb database but as usual spent more time looking for the drivers than writing the code.  First, I assume you have MongoDb installed on your local server.  Now install  Distribute, the python setup manager (<a href="http://packages.python.org/distribute/">for details on distrubute click here</a>)      curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py    sudo python distribute_setup.py    sudo easy_install pip  And finally here's some python to hit the database:    import pymongo    connection = pymongo.Connection("localhost", 27017)    db = connection.test    db.name    db.my_collection.save({"Name": "John"})    db.my_collection.save({"Name": "Frank"})    db.my_collection.save({"Name": "Bill"})    db.my_collection.find_one()    for item in db.my_collection.find(): print item["Name"]
