In a nutshell Better Engineering Practices are the processes that developers put in place to make their lives easier. The consist of the "Lessions Learned" over the years of experience  The benefits include reduce stress, increased productivity, better code, more time to learn and upskill  So why, you ask, is it so hard to get these practices adopted into teams/departments/companies. For the most part I think it's ignorance on behalf of team leaders and directors, people who have been beaten down by the higher levels to churn out results.
