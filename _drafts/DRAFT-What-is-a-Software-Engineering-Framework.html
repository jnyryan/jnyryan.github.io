<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<br /><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">This post is the first in a series about figuring out what engineering fundamental's you are missing as a delivery team and how putting them in place will not only ensure a better product delivery rate, but also less stressed teams and a overall better working environment.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">This works under the simple premise. <span style="font-style: italic;">If it's repeatable, it's automatable</span>.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">It's no surprise that as professional developers working in an enterprise environment we have all come across the<span>&nbsp; </span>same issues that slow down the whole process of delivering the product. I've lost count of the amount of times my team and I have moaned about awkward deployment processes, adding and removing features from releases, new features breaking existing one. Those are just the ones we can control, there's also the ever changing requirements, release dates that only move closer and of course the uninterested Product Owners who on release day decided that you've delivered something totally different that what they wanted.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">There is no golden solution for these problems. The truth is that each company is different and has different needs, wants and goals. However, the basics are still there. We want to architect good solutions, have good quality code, not be working late to catch up on unrealistic deadlines. We want to be able to focus on our job - be it coding, designing, documenting, architecting, testing or managing. We can't do this if we are bogged down in consistently in tracking down production issues,<span>&nbsp; </span>supporting the operations team on deployments. </div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">The powers-that-be in companies like to throw processes like SCRUM on top of them and walk away smiling saying "that'll fix it", but really all that does is bury the existing problems deeper and introduce a whole new set of issues. What they don't realise is that in order to get the management processes running, the basics have to be in place.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Where do you start?</span></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">There is a basic minimum that every team needs. You'll find tens of methods<span>&nbsp; </span>of over engineering your environments, but the KISS method is always the best.. Keep It Simple Stupid. First, identify the pain points. Where is the majority of the teams day spent? </div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Personally, I divide these up into 3 basic areas </div><ul style="direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0in; unicode-bidi: embed;" type="disc"><li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Configuration Management</span></li></ul><ul style="direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: .375in; margin-top: 0in; unicode-bidi: embed;" type="disc"><li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Code and Quality Management</span></li><li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; vertical-align: middle;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;">Delivery Management</span></li></ul><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration Management</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Calibri;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11pt;">This covers identifying a teams most basic requirements for</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;creating and managing changes in software. This is primarily to do with all the automated tasks. Everything from backing up your code to getting it into the public eye. When this post is written I'll put a link to it here</span></span></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Code and Quality Management</span></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">This covers techniques to make code better and more sharable. When written it'll be linked to here</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Delivery Management</span></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Finally this topic covers those factors outside the teams control, or at least those that seem to be outside control - like managing delivery dates and scope of work to be done. Here</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div>
