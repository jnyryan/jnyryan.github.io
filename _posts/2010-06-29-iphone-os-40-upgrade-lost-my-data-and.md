I recently tried to upgrade my iPhone 3Gs to iPhone OS4.0 using windows<br /><br />Here's what happened<br /><br />1. iTunes updated itself.<br />2. iTunes Backed up iPhone<br />3. iTunes attempted to upgrade phone.<br />4. iTunes hung half way through install<br />5. I rebooted and restarted iTunes and the install completed.<br />6. iTunes attempted to restore the old backup.<br />Result: all my data was gone. (texts, emails, notes, photos)... very disappointed.<br /><br />Next:<br />I repeated the process.... and tried to reinstall an old backup....<br /><br />Result: <br />No luck, turns out the new iTunes update deleted all my old backups ... not happy<br /><br />How i fixed my phone:<br />Luckily I use Windows 7 and used the Previous Versions functionality to retrieve old backups.<br /><br />1. I located the backup folder (usually C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup)<br />2. Right click the backup folder, goto properties>Previous Versions<br />3. Hopefully you'll see a old version of the backup from a time before you started the process (it should be a large file, mine was 185MB).<br />4. Copy this file into the Backup folder.<br />5. Open iTunes and attempt to Restore the backup.<br /><br />Result:<br />My phone was updated to OS4 and all my contacts,photos,texts and notes were restored :)
