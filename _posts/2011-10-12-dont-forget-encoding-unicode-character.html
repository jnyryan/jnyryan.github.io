Today, working with heterogeneous systems is a must and yet too many developers have forgotten more (or more honestly never knew) about Unicode, Characters Sets and encoding than is safe/recommended/sensible. <br />To that end I'd wanted to write an article on the subject but found one that does it better that i ever could.  <br /><b>This is a highly recommended read for any/every developer. </b>  <br /><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">ww.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html</a><br /><br /><br />
