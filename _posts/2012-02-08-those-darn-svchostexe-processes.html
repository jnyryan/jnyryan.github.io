So long have I just taken for granted that what resides in them is a mystery... no more.<div><br /></div><div>In case you don't know, the svchost is an executable container used to launch services that are now implemented as dynamic link libraries (.dll).&nbsp;This is all well and good until you get virus paronia and want to know what they happen to be running inside that generic veneer.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Well it's easy to find out.</div><div>1. Open command prompt and enter</div><div>2. tasklist /SVC&nbsp;</div><div>3. All the running process are displayed, including any dependent services</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iXVdmArFylA/TzKDGXuZZ-I/AAAAAAAABjA/iSBZpE_-rrU/s1600/tasklist.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="288" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iXVdmArFylA/TzKDGXuZZ-I/AAAAAAAABjA/iSBZpE_-rrU/s400/tasklist.PNG" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Easy when you know how i suppose</div><div><br /></div><div>... you could also use SysInternals ProcessMonitor available&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062" target="_blank">here</a>, but the latter means you don't need to install any extra tools.</div>
