##Applications

[Epic Browser](http://epicbrowser.com/)

- Internet browser with extreme privacy 

[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) 

- The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked. 

- The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained. 

[HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/) 

- Website Copier
	
- It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system.

The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer unprecedented visibilty into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended to introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into this exciting area of research.

- The Volatility Framework demonstrates our committment to and belief in the importance of open source digital investigation tools.Volatile Systems is committed to the belief that the technical procedures used to extract digital evidence should be open to peer analysis and review We also believe this is in the best interest of the digital investigation community, as it helps increase the communal knowledge about systems we are forced to investigate. Similarly, we do not believe the availability of these tools should be restricted and therefore encourage people to modify, extend, and make derivative works, as permitted by the GPL.

[dd](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)

- Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the operands
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
dd is a command on Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose primary purpose is to convert and copy a file.[1]
- On Unix, device drivers for hardware (such as hard disks) and special device files (such as /dev/zero and /dev/random) appear in the file system just like normal files; dd can also read from (and in some cases write to) these files. As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot sector of a hard drive, and obtaining fixed amount of random data. The dd program can also perform conversions on the data as it is copied, including byte order swapping and conversion to and from the ASCII and EBCDIC text encodings.[2]
- On Cygwin... dd if=/dev/sdb conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | gzip -c > h:/sdb.img.gz

[od](http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_od.htm)

 - Wiping of disks with known patterns.
 - Verification that the image is identical to the original drive, bit-for-bit.
 - Simultaneous output to more than one file/disk is possible.
