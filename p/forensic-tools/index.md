##APPLICATIONS

[Epic Browser](http://epicbrowser.com/)

```
Internet browser with extreme privacy
```

[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en)

```
The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network
of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your
Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit
from learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked.

The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux without needing
to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured
web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained.
```

[HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/)

```
Website Copier

It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory,
building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the
server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure.
Simply open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the
site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an
existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable,
and has an integrated help system.
```

[Glary Utilities](http://www.glarysoft.com/)

testers and IT professionals. With origins as a humble IT automation proof-of-concept
using an embedded dev-board, it has grown into a full fledged commercial Keystroke Injection
Attack Platform. The USB Rubber Ducky captured the imagination of hackers with its simple
scripting language, formidable hardware, and covert design.

 A tool that permits users to create Dr. Watson-compatible User.dmp files of any running Win32
 process, such as Csrss.exe or Explorer.exe, without invading or debugging them, and without
 terminating them when debugging is complete. This tool permits manual creation of dump files
 via the command line or a hot-key, or automatic creation when exceptions occur in monitored
 processes. The ability to create an on-the-fly "snapshot" dump of a process would permit
 someone to debug the problem off-line using a Windows debugger.

- Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the operands
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
dd is a command on Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose primary purpose is to convert and copy a file.[1]
- On Unix, device drivers for hardware (such as hard disks) and special device files
(such as /dev/zero and /dev/random) appear in the file system just like normal files; dd can also read
from (and in some cases write to) these files. As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up
the boot sector of a hard drive, and obtaining fixed amount of random data. The dd program can also perform
conversions on the data as it is copied, including byte order swapping and conversion to and from the ASCII and EBCDIC text encodings.[2]
- On Cygwin... dd if=/dev/sdb conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | gzip -c > h:/sdb.img.gz

  is intended to introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts from volatile
  memory samples and provide a platform for further work into this exciting area of research.

  - The Volatility Framework demonstrates our committment to and belief in the importance of open source digital investigation
  tools.Volatile Systems is committed to the belief that the technical procedures used to extract digital evidence should be
  open to peer analysis and review We also believe this is in the best interest of the digital investigation community, as it helps
  increase the communal knowledge about systems we are forced to investigate. Similarly, we do not believe the availability of these
  tools should be restricted and therefore encourage people to modify, extend, and make derivative works, as permitted by the GPL.

[DNS Sniff] (http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/)

```
- dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files, etc.). ***arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof*** facilitate the interception of network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.

- arpspoof

  sudo apt-get install arpspoof
```
