          My name is John Ryan, and as my slack-line says, I like to code/design and play (with technology).
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have an interest in security (mostly hacking to be honest - white hat) and I'm due to complete a Masters Degree in Security and Forensic Computing shortly.

      <h2 class="about">my philosophy</h2>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>
          <i>
            I've come to believe that Programming is not a skill, it's a meta-skill - it's a tool, it's a hammer, it's something that we use to create other things!
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          As we all are from time to time, I've been asked what do i do for a living. My stock answer was usually, "I'm a programmer!" - generally due to that fact that most peoples eyes glaze over when I try to describe the details of my work. On reflection, that's
          like a carpenter describing his life long mastery of wood as "I use a saw!".
        </p>
        <p>
          So it seems to me that that writing code only becomes an art when used in conjunction your others skills like arts, crafts, cryptology, forensics, graphics - whatever they may be, you name it. But without the alternate skill, writing programs is only stringing together
          syntax in a manner described to you by someone else! That's why I find the best software engineers have skills outside of their day-to-day working-set, and are always up-skilling and playing with technology.

      <h2 class="about">my work ethic</h2>
      <div class="post-content">

          I classify myself as a <strong><i>3-Factor-Architect</i></strong>. What's this you ask? Well it's a phrase I coined to describe the role I like to take in any job - I architect Teams, Systems and Strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong><i>Team Architect</i></strong> is about creating an environment that allows developers to be innovative and produce high quality products quickly - removing blockers that stifle creativity and focusing goals on the metrics that are important
          to the business. I achieve this using the agile and engineering framework processes Iâ€™ve gathered over the years, to I create a solid base from which to build strong development teams. I then guide these teams until they become self-motivating <i>product delivery teams</i>.
          The key to achieving this is simple, strong leadership that passes on skills/knowledge as the process develops - that way each team learns to self-manage and improve the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><i>Architecting Systems</i></strong> - this for me is the real fun part, it's where I use my skills to code, design and lead teams to build state of the art applications and software. I take a very hands-on approach and believe that coding, scripting and testing is all part
          of an engineers job no matter their level in an organisation hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, <strong><i>Architecting Strategies</i></strong> comes from understanding the business, it's customers needs and key drivers. This makes it more of a long-play agenda and usually comes from experience in the company. However, I find that
          due to their proximity to the data, engineers can have a perspective that Project Manager may lack. So I encourage all team members to run with ideas they have that will Increase ROI, Reduce Expenditure or Improve Metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I believe software engineers are multi-talented and multi-use. So when hiring us, we should be used in the same way. Skills are better when shared and engineers thrive when challenged and stimulated.
