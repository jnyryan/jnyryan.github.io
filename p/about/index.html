  <h2>who am i?</h2>
  <p>
    My name is John Ryan, and as my slack-line says, I like to code/design and play (with technology).

  </p>
  <p>
    I also have an interest in security (mostly hacking to be honest - white hat) and I'm due to complete a Masters Degree in Security and Forensic Computing shortly.

  <h2>my work ethic!</h2>
  <p>
    I classify myself as a <strong><i>3-Factor-Architect</i></strong>. What's this you ask?
    Well it's a phrase I coined to describe the role I like to take in any job - I architect Teams, Software and Strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typically I begin by <strong><i>Architecting a Team</i></strong> using the agile and engineering framework processes Iâ€™ve gathered over the years. I create a solid base from which to build a strong development team.
    Then guide these development teams until they become self-motivating <i>product delivery teams</i>. My key to achieving this is passing on my skills/knowledge
    as the process develops - that way each team learns to self-manage and even improve the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once this is achieved I move onto <strong><i>Architecting Software</i></strong>, where I use my skills to code, design and lead teams to build state of the art applications and systems.
    I take a very hands-on approach and believe that coding, scripting and testing is all part of an engineers job no matter their level in an orginization hierarchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, <strong><i>Architecting Strategies</i></strong> comes from understanding the business, it's customers needs and key drivers. This can makes it more of a long-play
    item and usually comes from experience in the company. However, I find that due to their proximity to the data, engineers can have a perspecive that Project Manager may not have.
    So i encourage all team members to run with ideas they have that will Increase ROI, Reduce Expendature or Improve Metrics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, I believe software engineers are multi-talanted and multi-use. So when hiring us, we should be used in the same way.
